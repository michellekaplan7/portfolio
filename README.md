## Introduction

This website was built with mobile responsiveness in mind to create a fully responsive website, regardless of what device is being used. I also focused on styling and animations to create a more interactive, aesthetically pleasing site. I also built in a contact form at the bottom, using EmailJS, as a way to get in contact with me! If you have any questions, suggestions, or comments, feel free to reach out. Thanks for visiting!

## Directions for Use

- When you first land on the site, you'll notice some fun animations and links that appear. Feel free to visit my Github, LinkedIn, or even view my resume!
- If you continue down the page, you'll notice different sections, including About, Projects, Experience, and Contact.
- As you make your way to my projects, feel free to hover over them for a nice surprise! You can also click on the Github and Visit/Demo Video links.
- The Experience section will tell you a little bit more about my work and education with logos for each that serve as links to the corresponding websites. You'll also see a list of my skills! More skills to come!
- At the bottom you'll see a contact form! This uses EmailJS, so just fill out the form and your message will land right in my inbox! (Did you notice the fun colors in the inputs for input validation?)
- The Nav bar uses react-scroll so you'll land on whichever section you select! Also, you'll notice as you scroll through the page, the active class is applied to the link in the nav bar that corresponds to the section you're on! Pretty neat huh!? That's thanks to spy from react-scroll.
- Did you try changing the width of the viewport and on different devices? Pretty responsive! And that hamburger menu!
- Hope you enjoy!
